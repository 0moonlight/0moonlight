Welcome to the world of Jiawei! I'm a researcher on various topics of quantum cryptography. Currently, I'm working as a postdoc in [Marco Tomamichel's group](https://marcotom.info) in Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore.

My research involves multiparty computation, bit commitment, and composable framework. For more details, see my [publications](https://jiawei-wu96.github.io/publications/).
